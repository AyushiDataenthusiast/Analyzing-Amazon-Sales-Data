Python-Exploratory_Data_Analysis
Hello Everyone, I'm excited to share this project where I utilized the power of Python and its various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to conduct an in-depth analysis of Amazon sales data.

Key Steps Followed:-

•	Loaded the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to leverage their powerful functionalities for data analysis.

•	Imported and loaded the data from CSV format into Python using the Pandas library, allowing for seamless data manipulation and analysis.

•	Performed data checks to understand the data, including examining the shape of the dataset, identifying any null values, and analyzing data types.

•	Removed unnecessary columns that were not relevant to the analysis, streamlining the dataset for focused insights.

•	Conducted data cleaning by checking and removing null values, considering their contribution to the overall dataset. Null values were dropped if their impact was minimal.

•	Converted data types of columns as required, ensuring consistency and compatibility for subsequent analysis.

•	Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to delve into the data, uncover patterns, and correlations, and generate valuable insights. This involved visualizing the data using various techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.

•	Made final predictions and drew conclusions based on the analysis, providing actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance.

Project Learnings & Conclusion:-


•	Improved sales experience by identifying potential customers across different regions and gender.

•	Improved sales by identifying the most selling product item types and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.

•	The highest Revenue was in the 2012 year but Highest Profit was in 2014 year, so the company should use the same plan as 2014. This plan will help the company to increase profit at a low cost.

•	The highest Sale in the item is Cosmetics and the lowest sale is Fruits. The company should give more discount on fruits and provide various schemes on this item.

•	Business mode is 50% Online and 50% Offline

•	The highest profit is in the sub-Saharan Africa region. The company should focus on other regions as well.
